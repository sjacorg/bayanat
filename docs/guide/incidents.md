## Purpose

SJAC's methodology in Actors and Bulletins follows a "closed universe" approach, where the only focus is the evidence contained in each item individually without looking for additional outside information. This approach allows for speedy initial analysis and prevents adding unreliable outside information. Incidents allow for evidence in individual Actors and Bulletins to be linked together and analyzed as a group.
