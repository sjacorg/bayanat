# Revision History

Bayanat logs every change made to all three main components (Actors, Bulletins, Incidents). The system has two levels of detail, accessible to users with the necessary permissions.

## Simple History Log

Accessible in the view mode at the end of each item. For every update:

- The user who performed the update
- The time of the update
- The workflow status used
- The comment left by the user

## Advanced History Log

In addition to the simple log, the system takes a "snapshot" of the item on each update. This allows comparing two consecutive versions to see exactly what changed.
