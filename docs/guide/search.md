# Search

Bayanat has a powerful search tool that allows searching every data field and creating advanced and complex queries. Available for Actors, Bulletins, and Incidents, and also for finding related items within any component.

The main search box searches text fields (titles, descriptions, names) and the last update comment. Additional fields can be searched via advanced search.

## Advanced Search

Access by clicking the button on the right side of the search bar.

### Any (OR Operator)

By default, search uses AND for multiple parameters in the same field. The "Any" checkbox switches to OR.

### Within

For date fields, specify a time window around the chosen date to broaden the search.

### Exclude

Exclude specific parameters from results.

## Complex Search

"Refine/Extend Search" allows building complex queries by combining multiple search queries with AND or OR operators.

- **AND** between queries returns results satisfying both
- **OR** returns results matching either query

## Saved Searches

Save current search parameters for quick reuse.
