# Verified Labels

Verified labels are neutral labels added by the data analyst based on observation and evidence found in the content. Allegations made by the source or persons in the content must not influence adding or removing these labels.

SJAC uses this list of labels to tag the reliability, priority, metadata, or the verified content. The latter is used mainly in items with verifiable evidence like video Bulletins.

::: info
Unless otherwise noted, the following labels were added to the system in September 2017.
:::

## Meta

Meta labels describe the metadata related to each piece of documentation.

### Actor Needed

The item contains information that merits creating an Actor profile, especially when there is no Actor profile for the person in the database. An example of useful information is a full name with identifying information (face, event date, etc.).

### Bad Import

The uploaded documentation has differences with the source or seems to have been imported with errors. For example, an Actor is missing the picture or the date of birth, whereas this information exists in the source.

### Confidential

Applied to all confidential or classified Bulletins or Actors that are non-public and contain sensitive information. SJAC supervisors identify which items should be designated as Confidential.

### Duplicate

Documentation is an exact copy of another piece of documentation. For example, an Actor has been entered twice into the database by mistake, or the same video is uploaded by a second source.

::: warning
A duplicate is not the same as Same Person (for Actors) or Related Bulletins (for Bulletins).
:::

The duplicate Actor/Bulletin must be tagged with this label. The original should be processed normally and the duplicate added as a related item with "Duplicate" relationship. Duplicate items should not be processed further; only the "Meta, Duplicate" label is required.

When a duplicate video is found, check which video is the original using the publish date. If publish dates match, use [Amnesty's YouTube DataViewer](https://citizenevidence.amnestyusa.org/) to find which was uploaded first.

### False or Fake

The credibility and/or authenticity of the documentation is questionable. Similar items can be discussed with other analysts.

### Flagged

Used to flag any Actor or Bulletin that needs further attention. For example, the item needs further work, the analyst is waiting for feedback, or the content is controversial and warrants team discussion.

### Graphic

The documentation contains graphic content showing traumatic material: severe wounds or injuries, dead bodies, severe torture, or postmortem offences.

### Important

Intentionally defined loosely to give analysts full discretion to identify data they believe is important for SJAC's scope of work.

### Irrelevant

The documentation is not relevant to SJAC's mission of documenting violations to human rights, international criminal and humanitarian laws (war crimes) in Syria.

Examples of irrelevant content:

- Reports about humanitarian conditions in a refugee camp or town
- Distributing humanitarian aid
- General strikes with no claims of any sort (but strikes claimed as a response to an incident like a massacre should be treated as non-incident cases)

#### Border Incidents

The item is about an incident that occurred on Syrian borders and is related to neighboring countries' border guards.

### Low Quality

Documentation is of low quality, hindering interpretation. For videos, poor quality or dark frames. For documents, poor scan quality (not for documents that are poorly written or hard to decipher).

### Need Assistance

Item requires assistance from supervisors or other analysts.

### OSF Project

Item is related to the OSF Project.

### Overly Discretionary ROE

Item involves overly discretionary rules of engagement.

## Reliability

### Source claims differ from visual/audio

The source's claims about the content do not match what can be observed in the visual or audio material.

### Source claims partially differ from visual/audio

The source's claims partially match the visual or audio content, but some claims are not supported.

### Source claims same as visual/audio

The source's claims match the visual or audio content.

### No Evidence

The bulletin's content does not support the commission of a war crime or any violation to human rights. This does not mean it is irrelevant, but on its own, it has no evidentiary value.

### Some/Weak Evidence

Regardless of the source claim, the content might support the commission of a war crime or human rights violation, but more information is needed.

### Strong Evidence

Regardless of the source claim, the content strongly supports the commission of a war crime or violation of human rights law.

## Content

These labels characterize the content of the documentation.

::: info
Unless otherwise noted, Content labels were added to the system in February 2014.
:::

### Media

Documentation from media outlets: news reports, interviews, articles, etc. Not from research institutions or international organizations.

### Report

Reports published by governmental or non-governmental organizations, or research institutions (UN reports, HRW reports, university research, etc.). Can also be a video report by a non-media organization.

### Interview

Interviews conducted for documentation purposes with survivors, witnesses, and others.

### Document

Government documents, correspondence, official orders, military documents, identity scans, etc.

Sub-labels for Document type:

- **Allegation**
- **Arrest Order**
- **Circular**
- **Confession (to possible violation)**
- **Confidential**
- **Detention Order**
- **General Order/Instruction**
- **Humanitarian Aid**
- **Identifiable Information**
- **Immediate**
- **Indirect Confession (to possible violation)**
- **Informational Publication**
- **Killing Order**
- **Personnel Inventory**
- **Predictive Report**
- **Search Order**
- **Secret**
- **Security Report**
- **Surveillance Info**
- **Surveillance Order**
- **Telegram**
- **Top Secret**
- **Weapon Inventory**
- **OSF-Document**
- **Other** (if other, describe in description)

### Non-Arabic

Documentation is in or contains a language other than Arabic (English, Turkish, French, Kurdish, etc.). This does not apply to subtitles or video descriptions, only the content of the documentation itself.

### Incident

An incident (hostilities, possible violation or crime) occurs in the documentation. The incident happens in the documentation: "something is happening." Usually includes battles, fighting, shelling, arrests, torture, attacking a demonstration, etc.

### Non-Incident

No incident occurred: "nothing is really happening." Examples include gatherings of armed members, meetings, announcements, defections, testimonies, formation of groups, movement of units without hostilities, etc.

Frequent non-incident examples:

- Pillar(s) of smoke with an allegation about an incident
- An airplane hovering with a claim about an airstrike but nothing visible
- A hole in the ground with an allegation but no remarkable visual evidence
- Demonstrations with an allegation about violence or detention but no visual evidence
- Audible weapons, explosions with an allegation about hostilities

#### Prisoner Release/Exchange

Content shows prisoner release or exchange between two groups. Usually treated as non-incidents unless they show evidence of potential violations.

### Post-Incident

Documentation of something that has already occurred. Indicates that a notable incident has happened. Usually includes mass graves, destruction of property, bodies found, videos of "martyrs" or injuries. Evidence of the alleged incident must be present in the content.

#### Signs of recent incident

Contains visual evidence of a recent violation that took place in the same location and in the immediate aftermath. The Bulletin must show evidence establishing that the incident took place very shortly before the video was captured (considerable dust from a recent explosion, people crowding as an instant reaction, etc.).

### Promotional

The content's main purpose is to promote an armed or political group. If the content shows any potential violation, the Incident label and related labels should be added. Otherwise, tag with this label only.

If a promotional video shows a specific incident (e.g., storming a building), it can be processed as an incident while also adding this label.

### Unsubstantiated Confessions

The content contains confessions about a violation that were not made freely. This includes all confessions made by military personnel under detention.

## Identifiable Information

Labels for content that helps identify an Actor or location in relation to an incident. Examples: ID cards, shop names, street signs, vehicle plates, language or dialect, graffiti.

If an Identifiable Information label is used, the analyst must explain the usage in the Description field along with timestamps pointing to the identifying information.

::: tip
Signs or banners held by protesters to confirm time and location can be considered identifiable if the content is related to an incident.
:::

### Ethnographic Information

Content showing ethnographic information about persons or places: ethnicity, religion, nationality, language, etc.

### Identities

Content that helps determine a given identity. Names, ID numbers, personal documents, special clothing, tattoos, jewelry, or other features unique to an individual.

This label is used only when the person is not already identified by the content. For example, if a corpse is already identified by name, additional identifying features like tattoos do not warrant this label. Only use when it is important to identify the person and they are directly relevant to an incident.

- **Face(s) detectable**: One or more faces clearly shown and matchable with an ID or photo. Includes faces of unidentified injured parties or perpetrators.
- **Name(s) detectable**: One or more names appear (e.g., ID card shown, full name mentioned). First or nicknames alone are not sufficient. The name must be of importance. Applied in high priority Bulletins with some exceptions.

### Symbols and Text

Identifiable symbols and text: markings or writing showing location, affiliation, etc. Includes unit numbers, titles, ranks, street names, license plates, graffiti.

Notes:

- When a symbol appears on a fighter's uniform, use Unit Detectable instead
- Vehicle plates: add only when the vehicle is directly affected by the incident (with Incident and Post-Incident)
- With low priority incidents, only when the vehicle is used in committing a violation
- Always with armored vehicles that have non-text symbols (colored symbols on tanks used as cyphers about the brigade). In similar cases only, use with Non-Incidents.

## Uniform

Used when persons appear wearing specific clothing that designates them with an official group, agency, or fighting force. Generally used when the person in uniform is directly related to an incident.

In post-incident content, the person may be a participant, affected by, or of direct relevance to the incident. Evidence of affiliation must be present in the footage.

### Government military

Person wearing government military uniform with identifiable markings.

### Government security/police

Person wearing government security or police uniform.

### Third-country military

Person wearing a foreign military uniform.

### Non-government militia

Person wearing non-government militia clothing/uniform.

### Kurdish

Person wearing Kurdish forces uniform.

### Unit detectable

The unit's name or broader affiliation is visible on the uniform. When used, Identifiable Symbols and Text should not be added. This label covers all symbols on a uniform.

### Rank detectable

Badges on uniforms signifying ranks (general, lieutenant, etc.). When used, Identifiable Symbols and Text should not be added.

### Unknown

Clearly a uniform, but the individual's affiliation is unclear.

### Plain clothed fighter

Individuals shown fighting but only wearing informal camo or plain clothes.

### Humanitarian uniform

Official humanitarian presence with individuals wearing clothing identifying them with a humanitarian group or agency. Only used when the person is directly involved in the incident. Not used for post-incident cases where humanitarian personnel are assisting in rescue, recovery, or rubble removal.

### Other

Fighters wearing a unique piece of clothing rather than a specific uniform (headband, ribbon in a specific color, etc.). Requires at least two fighters wearing a unified piece of identification as a group.

## Human

### Incapacitated

A person/body appears to have died or is dying. Not used if the person is unconscious, clearly breathing, or more likely than not still alive.

### Signs of Injury

Signs of injury directly related to a human body. Not used for blood stains or splatter unless directly related to a human body.

- **Wounds/Bruises**: Visible marks of injury on a dead body or living person. When questionable (low quality video, low visibility), the parent label can be added alone.
- **Maimed**: Visible missing body parts on a dead body or living person. Also applies to severed parts found separately.

::: info Surgery cases
- Claim of violation + person identifiable: Post-Incident
- Claim of violation + person not identifiable: Non-Incident
- No claim of violation + person identifiable: Non-Incident
- No claim of violation + person not identifiable: Irrelevant
:::

### Child

Visually clear that the individual is under 18 years of age. Difficult to verify for those above 15, so it needs to be more likely than not.

- **Armed**: An armed child appears in the footage, but not necessarily participating in hostilities.
- **Participating in hostilities**: A minor actively participating in hostilities in any fashion.

### Officer/Commander(s)

Clear from orders being given, uniform/rank/insignia, or other visual or audio evidence that an individual is an officer or commander.

The label can be added when:

- The person identifies themselves as a commander, officer, or states a high rank
- The cameraman addresses the person as one

::: warning
This label should not be added based solely on a claim in the title.

## Property/Buildings

In incidents, the structure is being damaged or destroyed. In post-incidents, damage or destruction is clearly identified. When a building is not involved in the incident but can help identify or verify a location, use Identifiable structure instead.

::: warning
Property/buildings labels can only be used when the building is or was directly involved in the incident, except for the Identifiable structure label.
:::

### Civilian structure
